Simple encryption program based on a random key.

Accepts command-line arguments to either encrypt or decrypt any given text: "encrypt"/"e" or "decrypt"/"d".

If a text file is specified at the command-line, the program will read and then encrypt/decrpyt that text to the same file name.

If no specific file is given at the command-line, the program will prompt the user for a text and then output the encrypted or decrypted text.
