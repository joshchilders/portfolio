This program generates a new word search each time it is run.
  The program is run by typing "python word-search.py theme [filename]".
  By just typing "python word-search.py," the user can see what themes are available.

There are currently three themes: the office, harry potter, and the lord of the rings which each give a different set of words to find.

There are also three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard which change both the size of the grid and the amount of words to find.
  The user can set the difficulty by typing "easy" (or "e"), "medium" (or "m"), or "hard" (or "h")(case-insensitive) at the prompt.

The program will print the puzzle to the terminal and will also write the puzzle to a text file as "word-search.txt" as well as an answer key as "answer-key.txt".
  The [filename] argument allows the user to change the name of the puzzle text file.

Have fun!
